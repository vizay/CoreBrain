How do I build a LLM Wiki? How can I future proof my knowledge systems for both myself and for AI, so I don't lose work, ideas, and knowledge between tools? The solution: a custom wiki, one that gets smarter the more I use it, a shared memory layer for myself & every AI tool I use, forever. For more on why llm wiki: https://youtu.be/n4EVksU\_EOs  
My Patreon (including the full kit built today): https://www.patreon.com/c/wanderloots  
  
The LLM Wiki has been gaining popularity lately as a result of Andrej Karpathy's github post, but it's a concept that has been around for years. Knowledge Graphs can significantly improve the quality and efficiency of AI tools as compared to standard RAG (retrieval augmented generation), especially for complex systems.  
  
It's incredibly important to get the foundation of your system set up well so that you can scale it to 1000's of notes in the future. In today's video, I'll walk through:  
1) the tools you'll need to build the LLM wiki  
2) the core layers (Raw, Wiki, Schema)  
3) setting up automation systems & python tooling  
4) Obsidian skills and workflows  
5) Advanced features like an agentic firewall in Obsidian & local model connections to make your LLM wiki free & private  
  
I've created a resource to help you get started with building your own LLM Wiki:  
  
This is a starter handoff file to give to your own coding agent so it understands the structure of what I built today, but in a way that allows you to easily customize it yourself.  
  
Rather than starting from scratch, if you want to have the exact llm wiki starter kit I built today, I am making all of these files (+ canvases & advanced features) available to my YouTube & Patreon Augmenter members. Your support really means a lot, so thank you for helping me continue to make these videos.  
  
Obsidian has been one of my favourite tools for years, where I've built my second brain, my personal knowledge management system. To learn more about how I organize my Obsidian vault: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWhMzDKA7vJ7p50vW-oeZgKR2aDReZFW6

### The LLM Wiki: A Shared Memory Layer For AI & Humans

**0:00** · Perfect. There we go. It just added all of these notes. Here is the new file I just added, and here are all of the concepts that have been extracted from it. AI is only as good as the information we give it, but information is only the beginning. We need a way to transform that raw information into knowledge that can be accessed by any AI tool forever. A separate brain that AI agents build and maintain automatically.

**0:20** · A shared memory layer, one that gets smarter and better the more information and knowledge I give it. One that actually aligns with how I like to think. The LLM Wiki, a structured system that you can build once and then use forever. Hi, my name is Callum, also known as Wander Lutes, and welcome to today's video on how to set up the LLM Wiki, a shared memory layer for AI agents and yourself. I already explained the why LLM Wiki in the first video, so today we're going to focus more on how to actually build it and get it set up.

### Today's Outline & Goals

**0:49** · I'll include some tips on how to enable advanced features like agentic firewalls between vaults and connecting a local model for free and private building. If you find this video helpful, please like, hype, and subscribe as I appreciate your support a lot, so thank you. Now, let's get started.

### The Core Layers Of The LLM Wiki

**1:03** · First, let's take a look at what we're actually building today. This system has three layers to it. The sources, the Wiki, and the schema. The first layer is the raw layer, so this is the captured source material. This is what's going to be compiled into the Wiki, where we're going to extract topics, concepts, entities, projects, whatever it is you want. You can make this your own. And the key here is that all of this is organized by the schema and agentic layer, like the agents.md file, templates, skills, command docs, all things I'm going to get into in a little bit, and that instructs the agent on how to maintain the Wiki.

**1:33** · And as new files are created in the Wiki, as the agent uses the schema to extract concepts from the raw material into the Wiki, the Wiki will cite the raw material. That way the raw material stays unchanged, the source is preserved, the Wiki is structured in a way that aligns with how you want for both humans and agents, and the schema is what keeps that alignment consistent.

**1:55** · It's the contract between you and the agent. I just want to very quickly mention that I'm not going to go deeper into the theory because I do have a video here on why LLM Wiki. This goes into knowledge graphs, rag, graph rag, and how a knowledge graph can improve the intelligence of agentic AI and reduce hallucinations. Now, there is a lot more that we can do outside of these three core layers, but this is the foundation that we need to have if we're going to build a system that actually works as it scales and grows over time.

**2:22** · But, I'll touch a little bit more on those advanced features later in the video once we get the core system set up. But, now that you understand the three layers, I just want to give a quick demonstration on what it is we're actually going to be doing today so you can see how these layers work before we start building it ourselves.

### LLM Wiki In Action (YouTube Example)

**2:39** · I thought that I would give you a very quick demonstration using one of my latest videos on attention and how to fix it. I can go up to my Obsidian web clipper here. I have my agentic vault selected here, so I'm going to click add to Obsidian. You can see right away it goes into my raw folder in Obsidian. And it has the full transcript with all the information. My next step is to go from raw, layer one, to the Wiki and extract the concepts from this raw file from my YouTube video. So, let's do that. I just said, "Can you please check for any new raw files that have been added, ingest them into the Wiki, and then run the maintenance?" Which I'll talk about in a moment.

**3:09** · It found one new raw source that's ready to be ingested, and then now it's running my scripts to automatically extract the Wiki. In a moment, once the LLM has finished going through, we should be able to see it expand. Perfect, there we go. It just popped out on the side there. You can see it just added all of these notes.

**3:25** · So, now if I go over to any one of these notes, we can see that it references that particular source. That just completed layer two. So, now if we go over to the graph here, we can see that the graph has expanded a little bit more to include the source that I have here.

**3:36** · I've color coded each of the different layers. Green is for raw, blue is for Wiki, orange is for the schema, the organization system. Here is the new file. I just added the new source, the raw material, and here are all of the concepts that have been extracted from it, and then how they to to the rest of the vault. And that brings us over to the third step, which is the lint or the maintenance mode. So, we can see that it just went through.

**3:57** · It's checking the changes that have been made, and it's just going to go through and make sure that everything that was updated was updated correctly. And we can see all of the changes in Git that happened here.

### Prerequisites: What You Need For Building

**4:08** · All right. So, now that you've seen the three layers, you understand what it is we're building, and you've seen it in action, so you understand how it's going to work. There are a few things you need to install in your system before we get started. We're going to need Python, Git, Obsidian, a coding agent, and optionally a way to run a local model.

**4:24** · Python lets you run repeatable scripts, which can save you a lot of time and tokens while significantly increasing accuracy. Git helps you with version control, acting as save points, which is essential if you're letting an agent mess around with your vault. Obsidian is the core memory system, the second brain layer for your agent to store files, notes, and make connections to produce the actual wiki. The agentic AI or a coding agent is at the core of the system, what's going to power it all. It runs the scripts, processes files, and can also suggest improvements as your wiki grows over time. I'm using Codex, but you can use any agentic AI today.

**4:54** · And the best part with this system is that you can switch to any other agent in the future. You are not locked in to one specific provider. We can also get a local model running, which means that you can run this entire system for free and privately. But for that, we're going to need another tool, and I'll talk about that more once we get the core system set up. Now, let's actually start building the LLM wiki.

### Part 1: Building The Core System

**5:14** · Okay. So, once you have all of the prerequisites set up, this is what the core setup and workflow is going to look like. Very quickly, I'm just going to map our steps. We're going to initialize the Obsidian vault as a Git repository.

**5:25** · We're going to structure the rules and templates and create the schema in the wiki and the folder system I talked about. I'm going to show you how we bring in that Python script, the tooling of the system. We'll run through a demo ingestion of a new raw source file, and then I'll show you how we get into the maintenance mode, the query and the linting system, and how you can run this daily. So, let's get started.

### Step 00: Vault Creation & Git Init

**5:46** · Okay. So, the first thing you're going to need to do is install Obsidian and create a new vault here. So you can just click create, you can store it where you want, or open an existing folder as a vault, but today we're going to start with a brand new one. So I just created this vault right here called LLM Wiki Starter. This is a completely fresh Obsidian vault. Now I'm going to go over to my Codex system and I'm going to tell the agent to initialize this folder as a Git repository so we get that file tracking, the version control, introduce the Git ignore, and then commit it as the empty vault. So I'm going to tell it to do that right now. Okay, and here we go.

**6:16** · We can see now we have the Git and the Git ignore, which means that this has been initialized as its own repository. And the reason that we use Git ignore is because there's certain configuration files in Obsidian that it would track over time as we make changes and we don't need to store that in Git.

**6:30** · And here we go, we have the commit has gone through. So now what happens is every single time we make a change inside of this repository, inside of this Obsidian vault, we'll be able to track those changes in Git, which is really important when you're working with agentic AI like Codex or other tools because they can make mistakes or it could corrupt your vault or have some kind of error and you always want to have that safe point that you can go back to with Git. And I do actually have a dedicated video here on how to use Git and GitHub with AI and why it's so important to do that. So if you want to learn more about Git, I'd recommend checking that out.

### Bonus: Obsidian Skills & CLI

**7:02** · I just want to have a quick note that we want to make sure that the agentic environment that we're using has Obsidian aware skills. So for example, if we go here, we can see that we have these two square brackets that have created this link as the node inside of this knowledge graph. This is a particular form of wiki linking that Obsidian uses. We want to make sure that our agent understands how to do that. So what you can do is you can go to this URL that I'll include in the description and you can use the CEO, one of the founders of Obsidian, skill set.

**7:28** · He's created a skill pack that you can use that allow you to operate agentic AI inside of Obsidian in a way that is going to be consistent. So I've already installed that in Codex. If we go over to plugins and skills, we can see that I have the Obsidian CLI, markdown basis, canvas, and defuddle. So, I've already included those here. You can just ask Codex or your coding agent to install those for you. And basically, what it does is it gives you specific instructions on how to work within Obsidian.

**7:57** · This is a really essential element on giving the correct tools to your agentic AI so that it can consistently work inside of Obsidian.

**8:04** · And if you're interested in learning more about skills and plugins and generally how the automations and everything can work within skills to get the system to be a bit more practical. I do have a video walking through how to set up skills inside of Codex. And because this is now its own Git repository, I can open it as its own project inside of Codex or whatever tool you're using. And just as an example here, if I'm operating inside of this repository, I can say, "Please list the skills you have available." So, it's going through and listing all of the skills, but the key ones that are available for this repository are that we have this Obsidian basis system, the CLI, the markdown, etc.

**8:34** · There's also this one here that I built as a firewall to prevent agents from accessing my other vaults, but I'll get into that in a little bit. And what we need to do first before we start anything is we need to go to settings and then general and then turn on this command line interface because that will allow us to use an agent to connect with our Obsidian vault directly. So, make sure you have that turned on if it's not already.

### Step 01: Create LLM Wiki Folder Structure

**8:57** · So, now we can move on to the first main step of the tutorial, which is creating the core folder structure. So, this is setting up the structure, the rules, the templates, the raw, the wiki, the schema, basically everything in layers two and three that we're going to need here. Okay, so I'm telling Codex to apply the next step. And just to note as well, I'll create a file here that I'll be able to give you as part of my vibe coding repository with instructions on how to set this up. You can take the structure that I'm using here for this tutorial and give it to the agent. But there we go, we can just see it already built this, which is pretty wild. It just created all the folder structure.

**9:28** · We can see them all appearing here right away. Now, it just has created a read me file, which explains exactly how we want to use this vault. And we have everything set up that we need. But this is just the folder structure to hold all of where the files are going to go. So, this is kind of the organization system for the Agenty AI. Next, we need to actually include the schema files.

### Step 02: Create Schema Files

**9:49** · So, this is the agents.md file, which you can kind of think of as the constitution. That's going to explain to whatever coding agent, local or cloud-based, that you end up using for this LLM Wiki, how to operate with this vault. We're going to also bring in schema docs, workflow guidance, all of these things here, and then commit it.

**10:04** · And again, it's important to commit as you go. That's just best practice. So, effectively, what we're doing here is we're adding the rules layer. This is the vault instructions. Great, there we go. They just all appeared, and if we expand the schema, we can see that we now have the files that have appeared here. And if this all feels a little abstract, it will start to make more sense in a few minutes once we actually look into the files. So, not only have we created the structure of the Wikipedia so far, but we've now just introduced all of these files here. And this basically produces the operating system for the vault, which makes the Agenty AI, the LLM that you're using, have more repeatable behavior, which is essential when you're dealing with LLMs.

**10:38** · Okay, so let's take a look. For example, if we open up the agents.md file, we can see that this is a starter LLM Wiki for humans and agents. So, it includes the core workflow, the default structure, the future script that we'll get into in a moment, the structural locations where everything should be written, and importantly, the non-negotiable rules.

**10:55** · For example, don't overwrite raw source material. We want to keep that as is. We want to use normal tags inside of Obsidian. We need to use front matter.

**11:03** · These are all of the core rules, and you can see, for example, something like front matter, we have a front matter schema on the side here. So, basically, what that means is if we go over here, we want to make sure that every single note that ever gets created inside of the Wiki has the same structural front matter. For example, we want to use consistent tags. We want to have a created date and updated date. We want to reference where the source came from.

**11:24** · So, it has a list of required fields, which you can kind of think of as just metadata associated with each note.

**11:30** · Similarly, we have naming conventions, and this is where you can start to get into more customization yourself because you might have particular names that you like using, and this can be entirely customized for you specifically. This is where the schema becomes really important because we have that agents.md file that points to different schema files, and then you can just go in and perhaps you've created some wiki entries and you're like, "I don't really like the way that looks." You can just modify the naming convention in your schema, and then every new note moving forward will be updated. We also have some workflow examples, and this is just valuable context for giving to the AI.

**12:01** · For example, capture the source material, run the script that I'll talk about in a moment, update wiki notes, preserve topics. This is again just a recipe that you want to give to your agentic AI every time it's going to be adding new files into your vault, extracting from the raw files, and then going through its system to maintain that structure.

**12:18** · We also have a lit checklist, which you can think of just as a maintenance structure, just a reminder to the agent every time you go through and make a wiki change, have you checked to make sure that all of our schema is correctly structured. is where the schema really becomes the contract for the AI, for the LLM, so that the agent is always writing into the correct folder, writing in the correct format, and then validating that everything is aligned perfectly so that you don't start getting some corrupted files.

### Custom LLM Wiki Skills

**12:46** · And importantly, as part of this second step, we now have this {dot} agents file and these skills file. So, what this has done is it's created a series of local skills that apply specifically to this wiki starter. We've created custom methods of operation on how we want our vault to be maintained, and that will use the schema and the scripts that we'll get into in a moment to consistently apply the same operations.

**13:08** · So, before when I asked this to list available skills, it gave a list of all of the global skills in Codex, but now if I ask it, we now have this repo local skills. So, it now has these custom skills like LLM wiki query, which pulls an answer from the index and the catalog and then only opens the relevant pages.

**13:25** · And this is where we get into a more efficient system than just using something like rag, retrieval augmented generation. We also have ingest, which is processing new raw files, maintain, which is the maintenance loop, like check what's different, ingest, build, lint, scan, log. And then we have the wiki lint, which is validating the front matter, the links, all of that kind of stuff. That shows how we build in these custom local skills within the vault itself.

### Step 03: Templates (Repeatability)

**13:49** · Okay, so now that we have our schema, we have the contracts set up here, we have all of our layers here, what we now need to do is start creating the templates.

**13:56** · And this is where we get into that final level of repeatability, where the agent's going to be able to go in and use the Obsidian file, for example, for sources, concepts, topics, entities, projects, and logs, and it will be able to repeatedly apply the same format every time. So, kind of like the schema, where if you want to make a change to the naming convention, so that the agent knows how to name the files moving forward, you can do the same thing with templates, where you'll be able to tweak them over time, and every time you tweak it, the vault will get a little bit better and more aligned with what you're looking for.

**14:23** · So, I've just asked the AI to now create these templates for sources, concepts, topics, entities, projects, and logs. So, we should see them appear inside of the templates folder in a second. Great, there we go, they just all got created. That just took a few seconds. So, now for example, if I go into a source note, we can see all of the properties being brought in from the front matter schema here, so that we have these consistent formats.

**14:44** · For example, a source note is tagged as a source. We have a processed checkbox, so that once we go through and process a file, we know it's already been processed into the wiki. We have a reference to track the source, the content type, all of these things are helpful, including the structure of the text here. So again, this is where maybe for a project note, you start to change how you're operating your projects, well, all you need to do is go into your template file, update it here, and then every time your agent works on creating a new project note, it will automatically be updated to use the latest template.

**15:11** · And just so you can see how this matches to the front matter, if we go up to the top right here and click source mode, we can see the three lines here and all of the different properties that have been included inside of our front matter. So, that's the same thing that we have right here with the YAML, yet another markup language. And just going back to the graph for a second, what we can also do, and something that I like to do inside of Obsidian, is we can introduce groups. For example, maybe I want to introduce the path of schema, and I want to make this orange. So, what that means is now we can see all of the files that are within the schema folder.

**15:42** · And I can do the same thing with templates. Maybe I'll make those white, and you can start to see here how we can color code the different components of our vault, so that we can start seeing where the various files are. And I know we haven't got into linking, we haven't got into the structure and how this actually works, but I'll show you that in a moment once we get into our example after the core system has been set up.

### Step 04: Tooling With Scripts

**16:01** · So, now we're going to get into the first coding component, which is where we're going to actually create a script.

**16:05** · The purpose of this script is so that when the agent goes in, it doesn't necessarily have to understand and figure out every single time what it needs to do. Instead, it just knows it needs to call this script. So, we can even have a skill built into our agent that understands when we say, "Hey, can you please ingest this file, or check to see if any files have been added? Can you please convert them into the wiki?"

**16:26** · It'll run the script, find everything it needs to, and then it'll be able to consistently apply the templates and the schema to keep our vault, to keep our second brain, our LLM wiki, consistent and maintained over time. It's really easy when you're working with AI for things to get out of whack or disorganized. So, the point of getting this all organized up front is that we only have to do this once, and then everything should be maintained moving forward. So, even though we have a scripts folder here, it's not going to appear inside of our vault because Obsidian doesn't read Python files.

**16:53** · But, if we go back to our LLM wiki here and go over to scripts, we should see the tooling be committed here in a moment.

**17:02** · Okay, there we go. So, that we now have these scripts inside of here. So, we can see that there's now a few different tools. And the point is that we're effectively giving the agentic AI wiki commands for things like building an index, checking the structure, checking the sources, searching the catalog, querying, the core maintenance, which is the wiki script, and then the audit. And for example, if I just open up one of these files, we can see that we have more rules built into this. For example, we're only allowed to have certain tags.

**17:28** · We don't want to go outside of our system here. So, this takes the schema and then turns it into code so that we're able to run more consistently. So, in the future, if you want to make changes, you can modify the schema directly inside of here. For example, we just got this command reference list that explains how to run all of these different scripts, how all of the different tools can operate. So, you can always modify this and then tell your agent to update the wiki\_tool.py file. But, there's a lot in here. And again, this is something that is going to vary depending on how you actually want to run this system.

**17:58** · But, the core features, the core code that we're going to run are things like building an index and a catalog so that the AI can quickly see all of the notes in here, maintain the structure of the notes, search the catalog, scan a raw file, update the raw source manifest, check to see if all of our raw files have been converted into wikis. Again, there's a lot you can do here, and I'll include some instructions inside of that agent handoff file that I'll link in the description afterwards so that you can see what types of commands I included inside of this tool.

**18:26** · Okay, so we now have created the vault, we've set up the structure and the rules, we've added the tooling. Now, we're ready to actually test this system to make sure it all works, and then we'll get into the validation to make sure that all of the maintenance and structure and rules that we have built were actually applied as part of the ingestion.

### Step 05: Raw Files With Obsidian Web Clipper

**18:44** · Just a quick reminder to please like and subscribe if you're finding this video helpful. I appreciate your support a lot. If you are looking for more ways to support me, please consider joining my membership on YouTube or Patreon.

**18:53** · Members get access to templates in Obsidian, including the core LLM wiki and the advanced system that we're setting up today, along with other tips and tricks as I build out my community.

**19:02** · Now, let's keep building. Okay, so why don't we actually run the ingest here so you can see how this works. I thought that a good first raw source to bring in would be my YLLM wiki, the theory video that accompanies this one, just so that we can start off with the theory within our vault. So, what I can do is I can go up to my Obsidian web clipper, and if I click on that and expand, we can see that it's pulled in the full video description, but more importantly, it's also brought in the transcript. But, we note here this has my old Agented vault, so I'm going to quickly go up to settings, go down to vaults, and I'm going to add a new vault here, which has to exactly match the vault name.

**19:32** · And we can see that I now have the LLM Wiki as an option, and I just need to change the source path. We have two options here.

**19:40** · We have raw for files and sources. I'm going to consider this a source. The files folder is going to be for PDFs and other types of files, but I'll touch on that in a little bit. So, I'm going to copy the vault folder path, paste that in here, and click add to Obsidian. And boom, right away we get that new file.

**19:55** · It's been added directly into our Obsidian vault. We get the full transcript of everything from that video, and it's now sitting inside of our source folder, which is great.

**20:03** · That's exactly what we want. And just quickly, too, I do have a video that goes deeper into bases and web clipper, which is a great way for you to structure and pull in files and different types of information. So, I recommend checking out that video if you want to see more about how I'm using the web clipper system as part of my LLM Wiki. But, the key here is that we now have this inside of our vault. So, I'm just going to go over here, I'm going to create a new group, call it path, and I'm going to just pull in everything from raw. So, we can see that this note currently has nothing connected to it.

**20:28** · It's just a stand-alone note that's sitting inside of my vault with all of the proper tags and everything that we're looking for here.

### Turn Raw Into Wiki (Test Ingest)

**20:36** · So, now what I can do is I can just go over to my agent inside the LLM Wiki starter, and I can say, "Can you please ingest any new files and then commit to get any changes?" I'm going to tell it, "Do not run maintain, lint, or query yet." just so you can see how this works, but normally I would do all of this in one go. So, let's click go. If you go over to our graph view, we can open up a local graph here as well. And inside of our concepts and entities on the side and inside of this knowledge graph here, we should start to see some changes in a moment. So, we can see right away that it's using the repo local LLM Wiki ingest skill for this turn. It found one new raw source and missing coverage for that file.

**21:07** · We can see it's pulling in the Wiki tool, which is the actual Python script itself, which is great because that's where we bring in more of the processing power of Python, more deterministically, more repeatedly consistent, rather than just an LLM running on its own. Skills help a lot, but so does proper Python tooling.

**21:24** · Great, there we go. They just all appeared. So, we have this concept now where all of these different nodes have appeared directly from this source. We can see we have a whole bunch of concepts that have been extracted here.

**21:34** · And it's updated the index as well, reusable concept pages, things that it can link back to. We have concepts like graph reg, which explains how relationships are used between sources and concepts to improve quality, which is kind of the point of building this type of system. And then we also have the related files here and a link to the source itself.

**21:51** · So, you can see how this starts to become a really seamless system where we have our raw source here and then we have the AI go in and then ingests it, extracts concepts, extracts entities, goes through and creates these key concepts, and over time, it will go back in and check, oh, for a new source, are there other topics that we can connect to? Like the concept of an LLM Wiki, which we can see has become the new hub for all of these files as the main topic extracted from this note. And if we go back to our global graph, we can see that we have a lot more files in here and they've all been interlinked together.

**22:22** · So, let's add a new group now and I'm going to make this a path Wiki.

**22:25** · Now we have red files, which are sources, the blue files, which are the Wiki. So, over time we're going to get more and more and more of these files as they all connect together. And we can filter if we want to, we can make this graph whatever we want. Over time this is going to expand and you're going to get thousands and thousands of sources in here and then potentially tens of thousands of concepts extracted. So, that's again why it's so important for us to get the schema and the tooling and the structure of everything set up off the bat so that once we get into more complex systems, the agent is always able to say, oh, you know what?

**22:52** · Let me just check the index and then I'll find the specific references that I need and then go pull those files. And if we go down to the Wiki log, we can see that we have this new ingest where it did these actions. So you can keep track of what the AI is doing over time. And again, this is where Git becomes important because let's say it does something and it ingests incorrectly, you can just always go back and roll to a previous version as a save point with your log being a clear reference point on the delta between where you were before and where you are now and then how you can get back to where you were. Okay, so that was the ingest.

**23:22** · So that shows you how we can pull in one raw file and then compile it into the focused wiki notes.

**23:27** · Now I'm going to go through the validate stage which is stage six here. That's where we build the catalog, update the source manifest, lint, and then check everything.

### Step 06: Maintain, Lint, Query (Verify)

**23:36** · Okay, so now I told it to run the remaining skills. So it's not going to ingest now. It's going to maintain, lint, and then query to complete the full maintenance loop. If you were actually doing this, I would probably have a little automation up on the side here where I have automations for my other vault, my main one that I've been building here. Once a week or once a day, however often you want, it will automatically run this entire loop that you're seeing happen right here so that I never have to manually tell it to go do something. It will just check. You could even have this be based on what's called like a heartbeat system where every 10 minutes it checks for a new file.

**24:06** · If there is a new file, then it will run the full works and if there's not, it'll just go back to sleep. But I talk about that more in my self-evolving workspace video. And here we go, we actually found some maintenance issues.

**24:17** · The query pass. There's a routing gap where LLM wiki and knowledge graph resolve but the shared memory doesn't because the catalog search failed to pull body text. So it's going to tighten this up so that it's basic query of the new files that we've added correctly pull what it expected based on the new files that are in there. There we go. So it went through, it updated the files now, and we can see that it correctly routes to the core terms. So this is just part of that system where we want to maintain the quality of what we're building here especially as the system scales to thousands of notes.

**24:44** · And as always, we can go on the side here and this is one of the benefits of using Git because we're able to see here are the exact changes that the AI made here so that it was able to find its query correctly.

### Recap Of The Core Setup

**24:57** · All right, there we go. So it has just completed the full maintenance linting and query verification pass. It updated some files, it rebuilt the catalog, it updated the source, and then it added the maintenance entry to log. Now, we don't just have the ingest, we also have the maintenance and verification. So, that now completes this core workflow.

**25:14** · We set up our vault, we set up the rules and the templates, we set up the tooling, we ingested a new raw file, then queried and linted it to make sure it all set up correctly, and then now this is something that you can just repeat and you can do it as many times as you want. You can add files, you can add notes, you can do whatever you want inside of the raw sources, and then you can just run this ingest, query, lint system, and you'll always have source traceability, compiled notes, a catalog that you can search easily and provide to AI, and repeatable checks that you're able to make sure that everything is being structured correctly.

**25:41** · And that's really the whole loop of this basic system, but there's definitely some more advanced things that we can get into.

### Self-Evolution: Iterating The Core Foundation First

**25:49** · There we go. We have the core system built. I'll also include a setup file in my Vibe Coding GitHub repository that I'll link in the description that you can give to your agent to help you get what we just built started yourself. If you want to use this exact system that I've already built today, I am making this starter kit available for my YouTube and Patreon members. Put a lot of time, effort, and quota into structuring the system and building it in a way that would be as helpful for you as possible, so any support you can give me is very much appreciated. Thank you very much to my existing members.

**26:16** · You enable me to continue making these videos, so thank you. But, the key here is that what we've built so far, the core, is just the starting point. The goal is not to make this just a one-time static build, but to iterate and develop it and tweak it and customize it over time so that it aligns with your particular workflow and how you like to think. I recommend doing this type of iteration first before you start bringing in advanced features like running a local model for your system, because if the foundation isn't solid, bringing in a local model is just going to make it worse.

**26:43** · You want to make sure it's working perfectly before you bring in a lower intelligence system, which is typically how a local model will run, even though it does operate freely and privately. You'll probably notice that the cloud systems like Codex work better at first, but the more you tweak the skills, the more you customize and optimize your system, the better the local model is going to get over time, and that's the true goal here.

### Part 2: Advanced Features

**27:06** · All right. Now, in the first video in the Y LLM Wiki, many of you were asking me to add a few more advanced features to the setup. Let's take a look at some of these more advanced workflows. The key ones that people have been asking for are this Obsidian safe system, the ability to firewall your other vaults from this Agentyc vault, a local LLM system using something like Ollama so that you can run it for free, one click commands for launching your local LLM so that you can kind of turn this into a really simple app, the ability to bring in PDFs, and then also my molecular Zettelkasten system, which is advanced knowledge theory that expands beyond the normal Wiki into my own system.

### Advanced Feature 1: Obsidian Firewall

**27:42** · So, the first one I'll show you is the Obsidian safe system I built the firewall, and this has a couple of different elements to it. And before I explain my way of doing this, you have to understand the way that the agent is actually connecting with the system here. So, we have all of these skills, and it's using what's called the Obsidian CLI. So, this is where it's interacting directly with your Obsidian, and it's designed for agents and for developers.

**28:02** · So, effectively, what we can do is we can create a wrapper around this Obsidian CLI skill that instead checks to see that the Obsidian CLI action is actually going through the specific vault name that we've included to keep the work within the vault and do not access other vaults. So, basically, what that does is if you try to ask your Codex or your other coding agent to write something in one of your different vaults, it will go and try, but the first thing it will hit is the Agentyc vault wrapper, and it will say, "Hey, I can't do that because it's not one of the safe listed vaults."

**28:31** · So, you basically create an approval list on the vaults that you want to give your agent access to. So, there's two parts to that. The first is actually creating a Obsidian safe script, and the second is creating an Obsidian safe skill. So, for example, if we take a look at the skill itself, we can see that instead of calling the raw Obsidian CLI first using that core skill, it instead calls the Obsidian safe tool that we built and then uses the Obsidian CLI if the vault is approved. So, it creates a wrapper that makes it a little more difficult to override.

**28:59** · So, just as an example, if I open up a different vault, like this is my Wonder Loot tutorial vault, and I go over to my LLM Wiki and I say, so we can see here it's reading that Agentyc vault skill when I ask it to write a note in my tutorial vault. And then it pops up and it says, "Hey, I can't modify this tutorial from this session because the active Obsidian safety policy only permits vault actions in this particular vault. So, I can work in that vault or I can work on a non-Obsidian file. So, this is where the wrapper comes in handy because the agent isn't even able to go try and write in a different vault.

**29:29** · Anything I ask related to note taking, it will only be able to go into the vault that I've specified.

**29:35** · So, perfect. That's already working.

**29:36** · Now, let's move on to the next advanced one, the local LLM setup.

### Advanced Feature 2: Local Model Setup

**29:41** · This is one of the other tools that you're going to need, which is called Ollama. You can use a different one, too. There's LM Studio, there's other ways of running local models, but the idea is that I can run a model locally on my computer, which means it's not sending information to the cloud. And even better, I can create a system that will spawn or create an instance of the local model running in my terminal and then do that whole Agentyc loop that we just talked about. You'll have to install Ollama, which is really easy, and then you can go and pick the model that you want to run. So, I have Code X just building a connection to Ollama right now. And here's a workflow of what Code X is just setting up right now.

**30:13** · Basically, I'm building a draft system for the local model. So, it's able to try and find the raw source, Ollama will create a draft, and then propose that to a review folder, and then I can approve that change, and then it'll apply it and trigger the maintenance loop. So, the idea here is that local models often make more mistakes than cloud models.

**30:32** · So, by having this review folder, this is just an easy way for you to create an intermediary step where you can actually check to make sure you like what the model did before you apply it to the rest of your system. And this is a concept that you can apply to your main system if you want as well if you want to introduce what's called a human in the loop system. If we go back over to our vault, we can see that there's now scripts, tests for checking this, and a read me file, and there's even a skill specifically telling it how to run. But before I test that, I want to add one more step just to show you how easy this can be, and that's bringing in a launcher.

### Local Model Launcher Buttons

**31:04** · Which is just a command that I can double click in Mac, or you can build one for Windows as well, and that will trigger or spawn the local model to do that entire workflow I just talked about. It's kind of like a mini app.

**31:14** · That way you don't have to try and remember how to trigger a terminal command or open an app. So I'm going to have Codex quickly build some commands to trigger a local model. You can just double click a button, and your Obsidian will automatically update.

### Testing The Local Model

**31:29** · Let's say I want to bring in my GitHub video. I can go here, I can click add to Obsidian. We got a new source in here, and now I can go over to those commands, and I could say check raw sources, and it's going to use Ollama the local model, and it's going to say, "Oh look, we're missing coverage on one source."

**31:43** · So then after checking the raw sources, for example, we can click draft with Ollama, and we can see that it will automatically identify the raw source and the model that I have by default.

**31:52** · You could go and you could change that if you want to. And now we have these proposed concepts on the side here. So these were all generated with Ollama, and these are all sitting in the proposed section. So then I could go and I could run my next command, which would be apply latest draft, and then it gives me the option to choose if I want to overwrite. I can click overwrite yes, and then it should have gone through and updated some of the files. And yet, we can see it's now created the updated version of these files. It's brought in things like Git that weren't there before, so the local system works. And that was all just using these simple launcher commands.

**32:23** · Now, you could take all of these concepts, and you could apply this to one of your other agents.

**32:28** · It doesn't just have to be running through the command line like I was doing. It could be connected to a self-evolving agent or whatever you want that could could running locally, or it could be done through Codex.

### Other Advanced Options

**32:38** · And there's a couple other things that I'm not going to go deeper into right now, and I'll work on these over time and start adding these to the advanced modules that I'll give to my members. We can get into improving the querying with rag and graph rag. We can set up a PDF ingest system so that you're able to extract markdown from the PDF and then run the LLM Wiki. We can bring in my molecular Zettelkasten system, which is just a more advanced knowledge theory if you want. And over time, you'll be able to start building this vault bigger and bigger and bigger.

**33:04** · You'll start getting these clusters that appear, and all of this will be fed into the AI agent so that you're able to build kind of a flywheel over time and improve the quality and the connections and just the efficiency and reduce hallucinations, all of which I talk about more in the Y LLM Wiki video. So, if you're still looking for more understanding on how this actually improves the quality of agentic AI, I recommend watching that video.

### Concluding Thoughts & Ideas

**33:28** · And this is just the beginning. The more you use this system, the more you work with AI to get it set up, you'll be able to customize it and iterate it so that it works in a way that actually aligns with your thinking while producing that shared structured memory layer for any AI tool. If you have any questions about what I talked about today cuz I know there was a lot, please let me know in the comments. I use your feedback to make more videos and answer questions that help everyone. So, I appreciate it a lot. There's so much more that we can build with this system, so I'm excited to continue exploring. And just a final reminder to please like and subscribe if you find this video helpful. Thanks.

**33:58** · Thanks again for watching, and I will see you in the next video.
